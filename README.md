# Deploy a financial microservice on LinuxONE using IBM Cloud Private 

In this Code Pattern, you will learn how to build and deploy a banking microservice with IBM Cloud private running in the LinuxONE Community Cloud. 

IBM Cloud Private is a private cloud platform for developing and running workloads locally. It is an integrated environment that enables you to design, develop, deploy and manage on-premises, containerized cloud applications behind a firewall. It includes the container orchestrator Kubernetes, a private image repository, a management console and monitoring frameworks.

When you will complete this Code Pattern, you will understand how to:

* Build a Docker image from an existing application.
* Deploy a Docker image to IBM Cloud Private.
* Run the existing application using the IBM Cloud Private catalog.


# Architecture

This journey accesses a fictitious retail banking system called MPLbank. MPLbank integrates an Account Management System running on IBM Mainframe. On top of this component, an API layer based on z/OS Connect EE and IBM API Connect has been set up to deliver banking APIs. It makes banking services reachable through APIs from all kind of applications. IBM Cloud private has been configured into the LinuxONE  Community Cloud.

1. The user deploys a Docker image (banking application based microservice) to the IBM Cloud Private Docker registry.
2. The user configures and runs a container based on the previous Docker image from IBM Cloud Private catalog. Once started, the application calls banking APIs published in API Connect.
3. API Connect calls the back-end Z Mainframe through a banking API published in z/OS Connect EE.
4. z/OS Connect EE calls the Account Management System (AMS) running in CICS. A COBOL program processes the request and returns banking data. Finally, banking data are sent back to the microservice application.

# Step 1 - Discover and locally run the banking application

The objective is to discover the banking application located in the *banking-application* folder. This application is a Node.js application. It will be locally tested before packaging it into a Docker image for IBM Cloud private.

## Part 1 - Discover the banking application

1. Launch a terminal (Command Prompt).

3. Clone your GitHub repository *zcloud(nn)-icp-banking-microservices* to create a local copy of the banking application:

   `git clone https://github.com/zcloud-01/zcloud(nn)-icp-banking-microservices`
  	
5. Take a look at the *banking-application* folder:

   `cd zcloud(nn)-icp-banking-microservices/banking-application`
   
   `dir ` or `ls`
       
  	* *app.js*: the application server code.
	* *public/index.html*: the application client code (banking dashboard).
	* *public/css*: the application stylesheet.
	* *public/js*: the JavaScript libraries. 
	* *public/js/bankingAPI.js*: will be modified later to connect to a corebanking system through API calls.
	* *package.json*: the package dependencies file.
	* *Dockerfile*: will be used later to build the Docker image.
